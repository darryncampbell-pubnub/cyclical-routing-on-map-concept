# cyclical-routing-on-map-concept

Abandoned demo to show cyclical vehicle routes on Google Maps

To get this application running:

* Add Google maps key to `/js/map.js`.  This key should have the 'Maps JavaScript API' and 'Maps Embed API' enabled.
* Add PubNub pub/sub keys to `pubnub_setup.js` This key does not need to have anything special enabled
